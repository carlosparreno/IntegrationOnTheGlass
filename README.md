# IntegrationOnTheGlass

## Software IT specialist ( IBM Benelux Internship)

### 2013 – Oct 2013

Responsible for an internal project of IBM Benelux called “Integration on the Glass”.

There was a large set of databases, applications and information assets that turned simple tasks into very tedious and long processes on daily basis.

The objectives of this project were to determine what the relevant information was and integrate it all into a portal, automate tasks, make the user interface as much customizable as possible and develop an extensible and reliable system. I was challenged to carry out this project development from scratch.

The result was a customizable portal that presented the needed info per user and also automated key tasks. Managers of IBM Benelux used Integration on the Glass for 2 years.

Integration on the Glass: IBM Notes Portal built with XPages.
